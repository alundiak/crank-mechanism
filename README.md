Crank Mechanism visualization

## Why?

The main goal is to have a codebase, repo where I could experiment with HTML 5 `<canvas>` API.


## What?

Crank mechanism is a mechanism where the rod attached to the piston influences the motion of a brick on a surface, creating a reciprocating motion. The physical concept you might be referring to is somewhat similar to a slider-crank mechanism, which is often used in mechanical engineering.


- [Reciprocating motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocating_motion) ("Зворотно-поступальний рух")

> Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.

> A reciprocating engine, also often known as a piston engine, is typically a heat engine that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert high temperature and high pressure into a rotating motion. 

- [Crankshaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankshaft) ("колінчастий вал")

> A crankshaft is a mechanical component used in a piston engine to convert the reciprocating motion into rotational motion. The crankshaft is a rotating shaft containing one or more crankpins, that are driven by the pistons via the connecting rods.

- [Crankpin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankpin) ("підшипник шатуна")

> A crankpin or crank pin, also known as a rod bearing journal, is a mechanical device in an engine which connects the crankshaft to the connecting rod for each cylinder. It has a cylindrical surface, to allow the crankpin to rotate relative to the "big end" of the connecting rod.

- [Connecting rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecting_rod) ("шатун")

> A connecting rod, also called a 'con rod', is the part of a piston engine which connects the piston to the crankshaft. Together with the crank, the connecting rod converts the reciprocating motion of the piston into the rotation of the crankshaft.
